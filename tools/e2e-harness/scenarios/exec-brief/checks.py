scenarios/exec-brief/checks.py — the nine acceptance checks for the
exec-brief scenario.

Loaded dynamically by `tools/e2e-harness/verify.py` via
`SCENARIO=exec-brief` (the default). Exposes a single entry point:

    get_checks() -> list[Check]

Where each `Check` is a `(label, callable)` pair. The callable receives
a `Context` (defined in `verify.py`) and returns `(ok: bool, detail: str)`.

Splitting the checks into a per-scenario module keeps the generic
harness free of scenario-specific knowledge (URL counts, foundry
endpoints, expected sibling pairs). The harness only knows how to load
the trace, transcript, and the scenario module.
